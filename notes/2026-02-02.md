# 2nd of February 2026

## Actions

- Reach out - plan meetings with supervisor going forward.
- Read Ullrich and De Moura

## Thoughts

- First step => create some AST model for a Rizzo language. Transform to some other representation with explicit reference count operations.
- Output target: (for now we will end the chain at inc/dec insertion)
  - Transpile to C. Pros: we know how to write/read C. We get the low level access to do pretty much as we like.
  - Interpreter - we could build our own interpreter. Pros: we have full control over memory layouts, headers, etc.
  - Use existing backends - llvm (potential headache(s)), QBE (simpler llvm, maybe).
- (extra fun: vs code extension with syntax highlight.)

- We have 16 weeks(-ish) left as of today. We expect these to include something like:
  - week 1: how (what will we do) + setup + reading material
  - week 2: experiment with the RC algorithm by Ullrich and De Moura
  - ...
  - week 8?: testing
  - ...
  - weeks 12-13: Polishing, final adjustments, all the small things(?)
  - weeks 13-16: report writing (we will ideally also write a little during project work)

- Tools/languages: OCaml (+ Menhir for parsing)
