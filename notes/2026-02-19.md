# 2026-02-19 supervisor meeting

## For ourselves
- Check that `output_int_signal` does what it is supposed to do. Say you `output_int_signal (const 5)`, then the constant signal is never cleared but maybe that is fine?

## Questions
- Would we be interested in turning out project into a paper? => ???

## Project
- Don't necessarily need a type checker yet => it is there in the syntax already. "Left" is 1, "Both is 2" etc...
- Typically you would have a big AST representation then you fill out information as you get through the phases.
	- GHC - GADT for the AST, then that type parameter provides "which" phase the AST is in.
	- Phantom types => ?
```ml
type 'a ast = App of ast * ast * ('a ann)
type 'a ann = { ... }
val parse: file -> srcLoc ast
val typecheck: srcLoc ast -> (srcLoc * typ) ast option
```
